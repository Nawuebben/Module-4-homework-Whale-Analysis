#Module_4_Assignment

##Purpose

The purpose of this whale analysis homework was to create my own custom portfolio and see how it performed against popular portfolios, and against the market itself (S&P 500). Extract importand metrics such as Beta and Sharpe Ratio to name a few.

##Notes

While getting help from the tutor, we continually kept running into warnings about python having a newer version. She helped my clean this up by adding ignore.warnings in the imports.
